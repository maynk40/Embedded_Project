# Development of a Radar System using Ultrasonic Sensor and Servo Motor Control with STM32 Microcontroller

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a radar system using an STM32 microcontroller. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to detect nearby objects within a 180-degree range. When an object is detected, the system provides visual and auditory feedback using LEDs and a buzzer.

## Features
- Object detection within 25 cm using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Servo motor control for 180-degree rotation.
- Real-time feedback:
  - Red LED blinking upon detection.
  - Buzzer sound for auditory indication.

## Components Used
- STM32 Microcontroller
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Futaba S3003 Servo Motor
- LEDs (Green and Red)
- Buzzer
- 7-Segment Display
- Resistors (220 Î©)
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: A green LED lights up when the system is powered on.
2. **Scanning Mode**:
   - The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor from 0 to 180 degrees.
   - The ultrasonic sensor emits ultrasonic pulses and measures distances by detecting echoes.
3. **Object Detection**:
   - If an object is detected within 25 cm:
     - The red LED blinks.
     - The buzzer beeps in sync with the LED.
4. **Continuous Operation**: The servo motor continues scanning while monitoring the range for objects.

## Circuit Diagram
Refer to the **Appendix** section in the [Project Report](PROJECT_REPORT_doc.pdf) for the detailed circuit connections.

### Pin Configuration
| Device             | STM32 Board (PIN)  |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Servo Motor**    | PB5 (PWM), 5V, GND |
| **Ultrasonic Sensor** | PB7 (Trigger), PB3 (Echo), 5V, GND |
| **Green LED**      | PD0                |
| **Red LED & Buzzer** | PA0               |

## Results
- **Scanning Mode**: The servo motor smoothly rotates the ultrasonic sensor, scanning for objects.
- **Detection Mode**: Red LED blinks and the buzzer emits sound when an object is detected.
